C++ STL list class is a good choice?
STL list doesn't support find the biggest or least

2.if select C lanauge, I need a pointer in linklist which point to node, that is not good

fifo 262
ref8 243
lfu 176
stack 243
clock 262
opt:188

tbd:
1.optimal crash
2."./virtualmem" should output "help", however, it still run the normal process
